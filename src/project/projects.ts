C# was used as the main language for software development, WPF was used for the interface. NHibernate was used for database access and RS232 was used for the hardware communication protocol. In order to generate reports, I wrote a custom parser with F#, FsLex and FsYacc. The report generator supported a wide variety of user-supplied expressions to be used in reports."
